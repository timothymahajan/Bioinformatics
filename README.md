During my Internship, I used the statistical programming language R to analyze data from Oracle-based Metabase, a database of genes, their locations relative to one another, molecular interactions, and drugs. I have written several programs and number of queries that allowed to identify adverse events common for drugs targeting upstream and downstream proteins in selected pathways. I have included my the abstract and poster to the research project, as well as the presentation that I have presented at conferences and part of the code that I have written.
