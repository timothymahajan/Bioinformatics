# Eli Lilly Internship: Summer 2017

During my Internship, I used the statistical programming language R to analyze data from Oracle-based Metabase, a database of genes, their locations relative to one another, molecular interactions, and drugs. I have written several programs and number of [queries](https://github.com/timothymahajan/Eli-Lilly-Summer-2017-Internship/tree/master/Queries) that allowed to identify adverse events common for drugs targeting upstream and downstream proteins in selected pathways.
